Touhou Patcher Installer Standalone Simulator
---------------------------------------------

## Description ##
This is a tool made to try and mimic the old english patches by creating a reduced copy of Thcrap inside the folder of the touhou game with only the essential files to patch it and create a new executable to launch the game patched. That way you have all the beneficts of Thcrap (updates included) with the convenience of the standalone patches.

## Main Features ##
* The game folder can be moved around without breaking the shortcuts (so you can have them in a pendrive to use on any pc).
* You can select a custom icon for the new executable.

## Usage ##
0. Get Thcrap from [Touhou Patch Center](https://www.thpatch.net/wiki/Touhou_Patch_Center:Download).
1. Run Thcrap normally.
2. Run this tool and follow the instructions.
3. Enjoy your touhou games in any folder.

## Antivirus Issues ##
I've seen various antivirus programs block the tool and/or the executables it creates, this is because some of them really don't like compiled autohotkey scripts and even less if they are compressed with mpress.
If your antivirus program of choice has no problem with compiled ahk scripts as long as are not compressed with mpress, then you can remove "mpress.exe" from the tool folder to avoid compressing the executables.

## License ##
This project is license free, that means you can use it however you want.
Having said that, mpress is not my product and you have to follow its author license (included in this repository as license.txt).

## Compiling ##
This is a simple Autohotkey 1.1 script, so you can use it and compile it like any other ahk script.
